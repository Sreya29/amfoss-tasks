## Begin your journey with Linux and Git
*Learning Linux commands and using them is the most interesting part of this task.I am happy that this task made me explore more about Linux and Git.Initially i thought this would take most of my time but once i learned the TERMINAL COMMANDS, i completed it within no time.I feel this task is really engrosing.*
